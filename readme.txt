This plugin protects your WPMU signup process against spambots with a simple math question.

== Description ==

This plugin protects your WPMU signup process against spambots with a simple math question. This plugin is based on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/block-spam-by-math/">Block-Spam-By-Math</a> plugin created by <a href="http://www.grauonline.de">Alexander Grau</a>. This only protects the new blog creation process and the new user creation process. If you wish to have individual blog protection use the regular Block-Spam-By-Math plugin on individual blogs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with the regular Block spam By Math plugin? =

Yes, you can run both. I use the regular Wordpress plugin on my WPMU site as well to allow individual site owners the option to add the protection at the blog level.

= Does this plugin work on regular Wordpress? =

No. This is only targeting the WPMU new blog signup and new user signup functions. If you need WP registration, login and comment protection I recommend you get the Block Spam By Math plugin.

= Can I change the math questions? =
Yes, just edit the two rand functions in the plugin file to generate whatever type of numbers you want.

= Does this plugin work on regular Buddypress? =
Yes. Requires Buddypress 1.2.7 or higher
